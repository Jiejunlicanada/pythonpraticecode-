###########################################################Basics of Relational Databases######################################################
##Engines and connection strings
# Import create_engine
from sqlalchemy import create_engine 

# Create an engine that connects to the census.sqlite file: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///census.sqlite')
connection = engine.connect()

# Print table names
print(engine.table_names())



##Viewing Table details
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData, Table

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///census.sqlite')

metadata = MetaData()

# Reflect the census table from the engine: census
census = Table('census', metadata, autoload=True, autoload_with=engine)

# Print the column names
print(census.columns.keys())

# Print full metadata of census
print(repr(metadata.tables['census']))




##Selecting data from a Table: raw SQL
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///census.sqlite')

# Create a connection on engine
connection = engine.connect()

# Build select statement for census table: stmt
stmt = 'SELECT * FROM census'

# Execute the statement and fetch the results: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Print results
print(results)



##Selecting data from a Table with SQLAlchemy
# Import select
from sqlalchemy import select

# Reflect census table via engine: census
census = Table('census', metadata, autoload=True, autoload_with=engine)

# Build select statement for census table: stmt
stmt = select([census])

# Print the emitted statement to see the SQL string
print(stmt)

# Execute the statement on connection and fetch 10 records: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchmany(size=10)

# Execute the statement and print the results
print(results)


##Handling a ResultSet
# Get the first row of the results by using an index: first_row
first_row = results[0]

# Print the first row of the results
print(first_row)

# Print the first column of the first row by accessing it by its index
print(first_row[0])

# Print the state column of the first row by using its name
print(first_row['state'])




#########################################################Applying Filtering, Ordering and Grouping to Queries##############################################################
##Connecting to a PostgreSQL database
# Import create_engine function
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create an engine to the census database
engine = create_engine('postgresql+psycopg2://student:datacamp@postgresql.csrrinzqubik.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/census')

# Use the .table_names() method on the engine to print the table names
print(engine.table_names())


##Filter data selected from a Table - Simple
# Create a select query: stmt
stmt = select([census])

# Add a where clause to filter the results to only those for New York : stmt_filtered
stmt = stmt.where(census.columns.state == 'New York')

# Execute the query to retrieve all the data returned: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Loop over the results and print the age, sex, and pop2000
for result in connection.execute(stmt):
    print(result.age, result.sex, result.pop2000)
    
    
    
##Filter data selected from a Table - Expressions
# Define a list of states for which we want results
states = ['New York', 'California', 'Texas']

# Create a query for the census table: stmt
stmt = select([census])

# Append a where clause to match all the states in_ the list states
stmt = stmt.where(census.columns.state.in_(states))

# Loop over the ResultProxy and print the state and its population in 2000
for result in connection.execute(stmt):
    print(result.state, result.pop2000)



##Filter data selected from a Table - Advanced
# Import and_
from sqlalchemy import and_

# Build a query for the census table: stmt
stmt = select([census])

# Append a where clause to select only non-male records from California using and_
stmt = stmt.where(
    # The state of California with a non-male sex
    and_(census.columns.state == 'California',
         census.columns.sex != 'M'
         )
)

# Loop over the ResultProxy printing the age and sex
for result in connection.execute(stmt):
    print(result.age, result.sex)


##Ordering by a single column
# Build a query to select the state column: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.state])

# Order stmt by the state column
stmt = stmt.order_by(census.columns.state)

# Execute the query and store the results: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Print the first 10 results
print(results[:10])



##Ordering in descending order by a single column
# Import desc
from sqlalchemy import desc

# Build a query to select the state column: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.state])

# Order stmt by state in descending order: rev_stmt
rev_stmt = stmt.order_by(desc('state'))

# Execute the query and store the results: rev_results
rev_results = connection.execute(rev_stmt).fetchall()

# Print the first 10 rev_results
print(rev_results[:10])



##Ordering by multiple columns
# Build a query to select state and age: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.state, census.columns.age])

# Append order by to ascend by state and descend by age
stmt = stmt.order_by(census.columns.state, desc(census.columns.age))

# Execute the statement and store all the records: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Print the first 20 results
print(results[:20])



###Counting distinct data
# Build a query to count the distinct states values: stmt
stmt = select([func.count(census.columns.state.distinct())])

# Execute the query and store the scalar result: distinct_state_count
distinct_state_count = connection.execute(stmt).scalar()

# Print the distinct_state_count
print(distinct_state_count)



##Count of records by state
# Import func
from sqlalchemy import func

# Build a query to select the state and count of ages by state: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.state, func.count(census.columns.age)])

# Group stmt by state
stmt = stmt.group_by('state')

# Execute the statement and store all the records: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Print results
print(results)

# Print the keys/column names of the results returned
print(results[0].keys())


##Determining the population sum by state
# Import func
from sqlalchemy import func

# Build an expression to calculate the sum of pop2008 labeled as population
pop2008_sum = func.sum(census.columns.pop2008).label('population')

# Build a query to select the state and sum of pop2008: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.state, pop2008_sum])

# Group stmt by state
stmt = stmt.group_by('state')

# Execute the statement and store all the records: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Print results
print(results)

# Print the keys/column names of the results returned
print(results[0].keys())


##ResultsSets and pandas DataFrames
# import pandas
import pandas as pd 

# Create a DataFrame from the results: df
df = pd.DataFrame(results)

# Set column names
df.columns = results[0].keys()

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)


##From SQLAlchemy results to a plot
# Import pyplot as plt from matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a DataFrame from the results: df
df = pd.DataFrame(results)

# Set Column names
df.columns = results[0].keys()

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)

# Plot the DataFrame
df.plot.bar()
plt.show()



###############################################################Introduction to Databases in Python####################################################################
##Connecting to a MySQL database
# Import create_engine function
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create an engine to the census database
engine = create_engine('mysql+pymysql://student:datacamp@courses.csrrinzqubik.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:3306/census')

# Print the table names
print(engine.table_names())



##Calculating a difference between two columns
# Build query to return state names by population difference from 2008 to 2000: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.state, (census.columns.pop2008-census.columns.pop2000).label('pop_change')])

# Append group by for the state: stmt_grouped
stmt_grouped = stmt.group_by(census.columns.state)

# Append order by for pop_change descendingly: stmt_ordered
stmt_ordered = stmt_grouped.order_by(desc('pop_change'))

# Return only 5 results: stmt_top5
stmt_top5 = stmt_ordered.limit(5)

# Use connection to execute stmt_top5 and fetch all results
results = connection.execute(stmt_top5).fetchall()

# Print the state and population change for each record
for result in results:
    print('{}:{}'.format(result.state, result.pop_change))




##Determining the overall percentage of women
# import case, cast and Float from sqlalchemy
from sqlalchemy import case, cast, Float

# Build an expression to calculate female population in 2000
female_pop2000 = func.sum(
    case([
        (census.columns.sex == 'F', census.columns.pop2000)
    ], else_=0))

# Cast an expression to calculate total population in 2000 to Float
total_pop2000 = cast(func.sum(census.columns.pop2000), Float)

# Build a query to calculate the percentage of women in 2000: stmt
stmt = select([female_pop2000 / total_pop2000* 100])

# Execute the query and store the scalar result: percent_female
percent_female = connection.execute(stmt).scalar()

# Print the percentage
print(percent_female)



##Automatic joins with an established relationship
# Build a statement to join census and state_fact tables: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.pop2000, state_fact.columns.abbreviation])

# Execute the statement and get the first result: result
result = connection.execute(stmt).first()

# Loop over the keys in the result object and print the key and value
for key in result.keys():
    print(key, getattr(result, key))



##Joins
# Build a statement to select the census and state_fact tables: stmt
stmt = select([census, state_fact])

# Add a select_from clause that wraps a join for the census and state_fact
# tables where the census state column and state_fact name column match
stmt_join = stmt.select_from(
    census.join(state_fact, census.columns.state == state_fact.columns.name))

# Execute the statement and get the first result: result
result = connection.execute(stmt_join).first()

# Loop over the keys in the result object and print the key and value
for key in result.keys():
    print(key, getattr(result, key))


##More practice with joins
# Build a statement to select the state, sum of 2008 population and census
# division name: stmt
stmt = select([
    census.columns.state,
    func.sum(census.columns.pop2008),
    state_fact.columns.census_division_name
])

# Append select_from to join the census and state_fact tables by the census state and state_fact name columns
stmt_joined = stmt.select_from(
    census.join(state_fact, census.columns.state == state_fact.columns.name)
)

# Append a group by for the state_fact name column
stmt_grouped = stmt_joined.group_by(state_fact.columns.name)

# Execute the statement and get the results: results
results = connection.execute(stmt_grouped).fetchall()

# Loop over the results object and print each record.
for record in results:
    print(record)



##Using alias to handle same table joined queries
# Make an alias of the employees table: managers
managers = employees.alias()

# Build a query to select names of managers and their employees: stmt
stmt = select(
    [managers.columns.name.label('manager'),
     employees.columns.name.label('employee')]
)

# Match managers id with employees mgr: stmt_matched
stmt_matched = stmt.where(managers.columns.id == employees.columns.mgr)

# Order the statement by the managers name: stmt_ordered
stmt_ordered = stmt_matched.order_by(managers.columns.name)

# Execute statement: results
results = connection.execute(stmt_ordered).fetchall()

# Print records
for record in results:
    print(record)
    
    
    
##Leveraging functions and group_bys with hierarchical data
# Make an alias of the employees table: managers
managers = employees.alias()

# Build a query to select names of managers and counts of their employees: stmt
stmt = select([managers.columns.name, func.count(employees.columns.id)])

# Append a where clause that ensures the manager id and employee mgr are equal
stmt_matched = stmt.where(managers.columns.id==employees.columns.mgr)

# Group by Managers Name
stmt_grouped = stmt_matched.group_by(managers.columns.name)

# Execute statement: results
results = connection.execute(stmt_grouped).fetchall()

# print manager
for record in results:
    print(record)




##Working on blocks of records
# Start a while loop checking for more results
while more_results:
    # Fetch the first 50 results from the ResultProxy: partial_results
    partial_results = results_proxy.fetchmany(50)

    # if empty list, set more_results to False
    if partial_results == []:
        more_results = False

    # Loop over the fetched records and increment the count for the state
    for row in partial_results:
        if row.state in state_count:
            state_count[row.state]+=1
        else:
            state_count[row.state] = 1

# Close the ResultProxy, and thus the connection
results_proxy.close()

# Print the count by state
print(state_count)
