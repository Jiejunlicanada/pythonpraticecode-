When you get a new DataFrame to work with, the first thing you need to do is explore it and see what it contains. There are several useful methods and attributes for this.

.head() returns the first few rows (the “head” of the DataFrame).
.info() shows information on each of the columns, such as the data type and number of missing values.
.shape returns the number of rows and columns of the DataFrame.
.describe() calculates a few summary statistics for each column.
homelessness is a DataFrame containing estimates of homelessness in each U.S. state in 2018. The individual column is the number of homeless individuals not part of a family with children. The family_members column is the number of homeless individuals part of a family with children. The state_pop column is the state's total population.

pandas is imported for you.

# Print the head of the homelessness data
print(homelessness.head())

# Print information about homelessness
print(homelessness.info())

# Print the shape of homelessness
print(homelessness.shape)

# Print a description of homelessness
print(homelessness.describe())

To better understand DataFrame objects, it's useful to know that they consist of three components, stored as attributes:

.values: A two-dimensional NumPy array of values.
.columns: An index of columns: the column names.
.index: An index for the rows: either row numbers or row names.
You can usually think of indexes as a list of strings or numbers, though the pandas Index data type allows for more sophisticated options. (These will be covered later in the course.)

homelessness is available.

# Import pandas using the alias pd
import pandas as pd 

# Print the values of homelessness
print(homelessness.values)

# Print the column index of homelessness
print(homelessness.columns)

# Print the row index of homelessness
print(homelessness.index)



# Sort homelessness by region, then descending family members
homelessness_reg_fam = homelessness.sort_values(["region","family_members"], ascending=[True, False])

# Print the top few rows
print(homelessness_reg_fam.head())


# Select only the individuals and state columns, in that order
ind_state = homelessness[["individuals","state"]]

# Print the head of the result
print(ind_state.head())


Subsetting rows
A large part of data science is about finding which bits of your dataset are interesting. One of the simplest techniques for this is to find a subset of rows that match some criteria. This is sometimes known as filtering rows or selecting rows.

There are many ways to subset a DataFrame, perhaps the most common is to use relational operators to return True or False for each row, then pass that inside square brackets.

dogs[dogs["height_cm"] > 60]
dogs[dogs["color"] == "tan"]
You can filter for multiple conditions at once by using the "bitwise and" operator, &.

dogs[(dogs["height_cm"] > 60) & (dogs["color"] == "tan")]
homelessness is available and pandas is loaded as pd.

# Filter for rows where family_members is less than 1000 
# and region is Pacific
fam_lt_1k_pac = homelessness[(homelessness["family_members"]<1000) & (homelessness["region"]=="Pacific")]

# See the result
print(fam_lt_1k_pac)

# Subset for rows in South Atlantic or Mid-Atlantic regions
south_mid_atlantic = homelessness[(homelessness["region"] == "South Atlantic") | (homelessness["region"] == "Mid-Atlantic")]

# See the result
print(south_mid_atlantic)


# The Mojave Desert states
canu = ["California", "Arizona", "Nevada", "Utah"]

# Filter for rows in the Mojave Desert states
mojave_homelessness = homelessness[homelessness["state"].isin(canu)]

# See the result
print(mojave_homelessness)


# Add total col as sum of individuals and family_members
homelessness['total']=homelessness["individuals"]+homelessness["family_members"]

# Add p_individuals col as proportion of individuals
homelessness['p_individuals']=homelessness["individuals"]/homelessness["total"]


##Combo_attack
# Create indiv_per_10k col as homeless individuals per 10k state pop
homelessness["indiv_per_10k"] = 10000 * homelessness['individuals'] / homelessness['state_pop'] 

# Subset rows for indiv_per_10k greater than 20
high_homelessness = homelessness[homelessness['indiv_per_10k']>20]

# Sort high_homelessness by descending indiv_per_10k
high_homelessness_srt = high_homelessness.sort_values('indiv_per_10k',ascending=False)

# From high_homelessness_srt, select the state and indiv_per_10k cols
result = high_homelessness_srt[['state','indiv_per_10k']]

# See the result
print(result)

# See the result
print(homelessness)
